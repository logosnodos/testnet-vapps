## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Monitoring Soundness BOT
- **Category**: infrastructure

### Description
This vApp solves the problem of constantly checking the Soundness dashboard manually. The bot automatically monitors new results from Soundness, analyzes them, and sends real-time notifications to the user via preferred channels (Telegram, Discord, or email). This ensures users are always up to date without needing to repeatedly visit the web interface.

### SL Integration  
The bot will integrate with Soundness Layer (SL) to:
-> Fetch evaluation/proof results from SL on a scheduled or event-based basis.
-> Listen for events/alerts directly from SL (via API or webhooks, if available).
-> Verify results on-chain through SL to ensure authenticity and data integrity.

### Features
1. Automated Monitoring – fetch results from SL periodically or in real-time.
2. Notifications – push updates to Telegram/Discord/email when new results appear.
3. Dashboard – optional UI to view monitoring history and bot status.

## Innovation
This solution is unique because it transforms passive checking (manually visiting a website) into proactive monitoring (direct alerts to the user). This saves time, enables faster response to Soundness results, and creates an automatic audit trail.
